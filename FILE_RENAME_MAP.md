## Files Unchanged
- TestScores.cpp (already followed conventions)
- TestScores.h (already followed conventions)
- NegativeScore.h (already followed conventions)
- CMakeLists..txt (configuration file)

## Naming Convention
All files now follow **PascalCase** naming with descriptive names that indicate their purpose or the main class they contain. This improves:
- Code discoverability
- Professional appearance
- Consistency with C++ best practices
- Searchability in the repository
